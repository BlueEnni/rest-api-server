# Webprogramming project DHBW Heidenheim

## Installation manual:

1. Install a mariadb server on your system. After that create a database called mariadb.
  
  **Linux:**
  
  ```
		sudo su
		
		sudo dpkg --configure –a; apt-get -y update; apt-get -y install mariadb-server; mysql -u root;
  ``` 
	
    
		CREATE DATABASE mariadb CHARACTER SET = 'utf8mb4'  COLLATE = 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'; set password for 'root'@'localhost' = password('root'); flush privileges; exit;

  ```	
		apt-get -y install nodejs npm; npm install -g n; n 10.19.0; PATH="$PATH"
  ```	
		
2. Now create a 'Code-Folder' and move your downloaded zip-file into it (optional) and unzip it afterwards:

  **Linux:**
  
  ```
    sudo wget https://github.com/BlueEnni/rest-api-server/archive/1.2.zip; mkdir Code; mv ./rest-api-server-1.2.zip ./Code/; cd Code/; unzip rest-api-server-1.2.zip
  ```

3. Now go into the code folder until you are on the same root level as the app.js file is and use 'npm install' to get all required dependencies:

  **Linux:**

  ```
		cd ./rest-api-server-1.1/; sudo npm install
	
  ```	

4. Now rename the .env.empty file to .env and enter db connection information:
	
  **Linux:**

  ```
		mv .env.empty ./.env; nano .env
  ```

*Connection data (can differ if you'll use your own db – located on a different device):*

  ```
		DB_HOST=localhost
		DB_USER=root
		DB_USER_PASSWORD=root
		DB_NAME=mariadb
	
  ```
  
  Now press:
  ``` 
		ctrl+o (for save)
		Enter (for approving)
		ctrl+x (for exiting the editor)
  ```	

5. Now install the browser the application was tested on:
	
  **Linux:**

  ```
		sudo wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb; sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
  ```

6. Now start the node backend-server with 'npm start':
	
  **Linux:**

  ```
		npm start
  ```

7. Open another terminal, switch to the frontend folder and install the angular cli:
	
  **Linux:**
		
  ```  
    sudo su
		
		cd Code/rest-api-server-1.1/frontend/; npm install -g @angular/cli -n; npm install; ng serve 
  ```
